 <h4>What is Flipkart Kaun Who Did It Quiz?</h4>
 Flipkart Kaun Who Did It Quiz {curDate} is a new daily quiz available via the Games section of the app. As the 
 name suggests, the video quiz is designed in such a way that participants need to find who did it. If
  you are wondering what it means then it is murder. The goal of the participants is to find out who is
   the murder.
<br></br>
It is one of the many video contests run by the Walmart-owned e-commerce company. The idea here is
 a show where two police officers investigate a crime and break down details of possible suspects.
  This is very much similar to crime TV shows that you would have seen on various TV channels. However,
   there is a twist.

While these officers investigate, you need to do your own investigation to find the right answer. To participate, you must set aside at least 20 minutes of your time and towards the end of the video, you will be asked to name the murderer. If you answer correctly, then you can win a Tecno POVA smartphone or guaranteed prize of at least one supercoin. 
Put on your investigator hat and get started.
