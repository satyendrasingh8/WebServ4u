   period of just four hours. On Amazon Daily Quiz, the winner is selected using a lucky draw.

   flipkart trivia today, on the other hand, has a total of 5,000 winners and they are selected on 
the first come first serve basis. If you are one of the first 5,000 participants to answer all
 the questions correctly then you become eligible to claim a reward. today's flipkart trivia questions and 
 answers also does not offer prizes that are as attractive as the one found on Amazon Funzone.

the correct answer or not. On Flipkart, after you answer all the questions, it shows whether you
 answered correctly.
